### Project Title

US Bikeshare Data

### Description

In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I import the data from csv files containing data for each city and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. It provides an interactive experience for users such that they can decide how to filter the data.

### Files used

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities in .csv format ('chicago.csv'; 'new_york_city.csv'; 'washington.csv'). All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

### Credits

This project was done as part of Udacity's Nanodegree - Programming for Data Science with Python. Starter code, instructions and clean datasets were provided by Udacity.
